				<p style="color:white;">
					Genshin Impact is a free-to-play open-world action RPG developed by Hoyoverse, a video game developer based in Shanghai, China. The game brings players to the visually stunning world of Teyvat. The player takes on the role of the mysterious “Traveler” who sets off on a journey to discover the fate of their lost sibling and unveils the mysterious secrets of Teyvat along the way.
				</p>
				<p style="color:white;">
					In this vast world, you can explore seven nations, meet a diverse cast of characters with unique personalities and abilities, and fight powerful enemies together with them, all on the way during your quest to find your lost sibling. You can also wander freely, immersing yourself in a world filled with life, and let your sense of wonder lead you to uncover all of its mysteries… Until you are at long last reunited with your lost sibling and bear witness to the culmination of all things at the end of your journey.

				<h1 style="color:white;"><i>What is Genshin Impact ?</i></h1><hr>
				<p style="color:white;">
					Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.

				<p style="color:white;">
					Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.

					Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017. The game generally received positive reviews, with critics praising its combat mechanics and the immersive open world but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022.

<h2>Game (Out Of Topic)</h2><hr>
<h1 style="color:white;"> <a href="snake.html" style="color:white;"> Snake </a> (video game genre)</h1>
<p style="color:white;">
	Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in the 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food eaten—often apples or eggs. The simplicity and low technical requirements of snake games have resulted in hundreds of versions—some of which have the word snake or worm in the title—for many platforms.
</p>
<p style="color:white;">
	1982's Tron arcade game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay for the single-player Light Cycle segment and some later snake games borrow the theme. After a version simply called Snake was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in snake games as it found a larger audience.
